I'm at my best when I'm creating something. It enables me to think about things that I haven't thought about before, to stay disciplined, to take care of myself and also bring others along on the journey.

The net effect of choosing the path of the creator, or in other words, dedicating myself to create something, makes life worth living.

This is why I feel like creation is the sauce of life.

At the core of all our activities, we are creating. Whether it's a business, a family, music, art, solutions to problems, or life itself.

The process of creation is spiritual. It enforces growth.
The desire to create begins an adventure.
The creator has to prove to the universe that they are worthy of creating the outcomes they desire.
They do this by overcoming the obstacles and hurdles that inevitably appear on the path of creation. Overcoming these obstacles requires courage, discipline, ingenuity and a litany of other values that make humans great.

When the Buddha figured out that desire was the root of all suffering, he wasn't pointing out that we should avoid suffering, or that desire is bad.
He was simply pointing out that if you have a desire, you better be willing to embrace the suffering.
This applies to the desire to create as well.

Suffering is necessary but it does not have to be painful. This is something that the stoics figured out. They knew that ups and downs, lows and highs are all the same; two extremes of the same spectrum of emotion.

Having a steady mind, treating pleasure and pain like the same imposters, makes you the master of life.

The difference between a master of creation and a novice, is how they react to or experience the suffering involved in the process of creation. The greatest creators understand that creation is going to bring suffering, there's no way around it, and they are prepared to face it.

The inexperienced creator is naive, and assumes that creation is going to be a walk in the park, almost effortless. They make this false assumption because they watch the greats do their thing and it _looks_ effortless, oblivious to the fact that the willingness to face adversity is the most powerful tool for creation.

It is up to each individual whether they want to be great creators or not. That is optional.
But the act of creating is not. You have to create something.
Life is meaningless without this.
